Release Showstoppers
--------------------

* When headers are added (or added with a blank value) they should over-
  ride (or disable) a pre-existing header value for the same header.
  - Perhaps allow multiple Cookie headers, to support this spec violation?

* Docuemnt typically usage, including how to deal with file-descriptor
  limits and other OS-limitations (eg. Mac OS X). (man page?)

* Document typical build instructions, including use of LDFLAGS and
  CFLAGS (eg.
    CFLAGS="-Wall -g -I/usr/local/include" \
    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure

* Write support for "make install".

* Optionally allow the client to continue trying to connect even upon
  connect failure, if there have been successful connects already. This
  will let us maintain load on a server instead of suddenly stopping the
  test.

* We seem to be leaking file descriptors in the error code path.

Known Bugs
----------

* When the client runs out of sockets, we get an EADDRNOTAVAIL (on Solaris 10)
  which looks like "Can't assign requested address". We should either
  provide instructions for increasing system limits or we should retry
  for a short period of time until the problem resolves itself.

* Doesn't work on Mac OS X/Darwin due to bug in kqueue that doesn't handle
  non-blocking connect() calls. (Requires disabling kqueue by setting an
  environment variable that is picked up by libevent.)

* Libevent-1.1a has a devpoll bug, here's the patch to fix it:

Wishlist
--------

* Add a reasonable global timeout so that any stalled sockets will be
  terminated after X seconds (where X is something like 120).

* Resolve DNS once per request, not only once at startup, to support services
  that use round-robin DNS.

* Allow setting of buffer sizes at runtime.

* Add support for delays at various points in the request/response
  state to allow for higher concurrency testing without overloading
  the client or server CPUs or network unnecessarily.

* Track which request iteration hits for the min/max.

* Support persistent HTTP sessions (keepalive).

Done
----

Release 0.1.0 (previously called 0.0.1):

* Basic functionality, multiple URLs, global timing metrics.

* Added support for various debugging output levels through the -v option.

* Added support for Solaris, tested on Solaris 10. Doesn't currently work
  on Mac OS X due to lame non-blocking connect + kqueue bug in darwin.

* Fixed a parsing bug that caused URI string corruption due to missing
  space for null characters at the end of strings.

* Improve body read draining by allowing up to 128k sized reads. With
  new TCP/IP stacks that dynamically size the socket buffers, it's
  very likely that this will be used often.

* Allow up to 8k in the receive header line, fail if larger.

* Only use one static buffer for draining the response body, instead
  of allocating for every call to process_reading_body(). This isn't
  really that much more efficient, except for maybe some cache hits
  in the kernel's read() implementation, and may be changed back
  if I start doing body-based validation later.

* Per-URL average (mean) timing metrics and printed output after running
  the test.

* Keep track of max simultaneously connected sockets.

* Per-URL min/max timing metrics and printed output.

* Global min/max timing metrics.

* Split out the parse_uri routine into its own module (for separate
  licensing).

* Added LICENSE and Copyright notices to most files in preparation
  for first distribution.

* Added build/roll.sh to automate rolling of tarballs.


Release 0.2.0:

* Fix non-blocking connect(). There was a bug that treated in-progress
  connect() attempts as being complete, which skewed the metrics and
  caused the next state to block until the connect completed.

* Improved handling of EADDRNOTAVAIL which happens when we run out of
  client ports. This support is not yet fully tested and probably
  needs more work.

* Added support at verbosity level 1 for printing the timing metrics
  (connect/read/write/close) for every request as it completes.

* Fix off-by-two error when calculating header length that would cause
  extra junk to be written to the request after the end of the headers.

* Add support for tracking the time until the first byte is received
  from the server.

* Always add the "Connection: close" header to requests, since we don't
  currently support KeepAlive requests in Plethora.


Release 0.2.1:

* Fix a bug in the location resolver that ignored the -C parameter for
  overriding the hostname from the test URL.

* Only print the metrics for each request when two or more -v's are used.

* Added support for ports into the -C parameter, for example:
    -C www.example.com:81


Release 0.2.2:

* Added support for checking and reporting on HTTP response failures.
  Anything 4xx or 5xx is considered a fatal error.


Release 0.2.3:

* Added support for overwriting headers using the -H parameter.

* Changed default behavior so that the socket is no longer shutdown
  for writes on the client side after sending the headers. Some HTTP
  implementations (like Akami) appear to be incompatible with this
  behavior.

* Added support for (-o) halfopen parameter, so that we can still have
  the halfopen behavior if desired (where we shutdown the socket for
  writes on client side after sending the headers).


Release 0.2.4:
